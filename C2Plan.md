# Sprint 2 Plan

## Topics
- Refactoring

When adding a new feature is much harder than expected.
When fixing a bug (that should be cohesive) requires changes that are scattered across the system.
When performing a code review for a simple feature/defect that requires complex changes that are hard to understand.

- Clients will be able to submit for new input data format (HTML)
- Extends the EBNF
- lint rules change


## Questions
- What are some limitations you noticed with the design of your C1 implementation?
- Does your code violate any of the new lint rules? How do you plan to systematically address these violations?
- Are you planning to change your implementation? In what ways? When do you think is the best time to refactor the implementation?

- How will you document refactorings:
  - Should they be dedicated user stories (issues) why or why not?
  - A dedicated commit
 
- Recall that refactors should not change the behaviour of the system. Describe a strategy you will use to ensure you do not inadvertently introduce behavioural changes into your system.
