# C0 Sprint Plan

## Topics
- Specification decomposition -> how to read a spec
- Async -> links to Async Cookbook
- Black box testing
  - Inputs
  - Boudary values
  - Partitions
- Can you describe why we evaluate your test suite using mutation testing?

Read/watch XX.

## Questions

### Identifying test cases
- Map the spec to test cases (create a list of all tests from the spec using precise and concise English descriptions). It might help to consider Input, BVC, Partitions.
- Choose some of the test cases and describe how you would assert the behaviour of InsightUBC (TAs will give feedback on up to three).

### Familiarizing yourself with test framework

### 


(Retro)
- Would fuzz testing have been helpful? In what way(s)?
- (Testability) How did you have to test the system? Was it  easy? Fast?
- (Assertions) How did you evaluate your assertions
